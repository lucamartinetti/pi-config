/**
 * fleet-list.ts — Claude Code-style "FleetView" list rendered below the editor.
 *
 * Shows `main` + each running/queued subagent as a navigable list. Pressing ↓ (or
 * ←) at an empty prompt activates the list; ↑/↓ move the selection (filled ● marker),
 * Enter opens the selected agent's live conversation overlay, Esc returns to the prompt.
 * A viewer stays open when its agent finishes; finished agents linger briefly in the list.
 *
 * Mechanics (see plan): the list is a `belowEditor` widget (render-only), and ALL key
 * handling goes through `onTerminalInput` — which fires before the focused editor and
 * can `consume` keys — gated on `getEditorText() === ""` so normal typing is untouched.
