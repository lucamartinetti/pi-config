/**
 * worktree.ts — Git worktree isolation for agents.
 *
 * Creates a temporary git worktree so the agent works on an isolated copy of the repo.
 * On completion, if no changes were made, the worktree is cleaned up.
 * If changes exist, a branch is created and returned in the result.
 *
 * Every git call goes through `pi.exec` (async) rather than `execFileSync`: a
 * worktree copy can take seconds, and a session that spawns several isolated
 * agents at once would otherwise serialize them all on the TUI's event loop.
