/**
 * progress.ts — the workflow progress model, ported from Claude Code.
 *
 * Progress is an **append-only event log**, not a tree. Agent entries are keyed
 * by `index` and last-write-wins, so a running agent is updated by appending a
 * fresh entry with the same index rather than mutating anything. Every view —
 * the inline card, the workflows dialog, the fleet widget — derives its shape
 * by collapsing that log. Keeping the log authoritative is what lets a batched
 * update carry several agents' changes in one message from the worker.
 *
 * Two vocabularies, deliberately distinct:
 *   - entry `state` is only start | progress | done | error, with `skipped`,
 *     `blocked` and `cached` as separate booleans;
 *   - the display state adds queued, running, interrupted, skipped, blocked and
 *     failed, and is *derived* (see `displayState`).
 * Mixing them up is the easiest way to get the rendering wrong, which is why
 * the derivation lives here as one function rather than inline in each renderer.
 *
 * Everything in this file is pure and framework-free so the whole model is
 * unit-testable without a terminal.
