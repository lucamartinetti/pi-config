/**
 * saved.ts — resolve `SubagentWorkflow({ name })` to a script on disk.
 *
 * A saved workflow is a plain `.js` file whose contents are exactly what
 * `script` would have carried. Nothing is parsed here: `extractMeta` still runs
 * over the source at the call site, so a saved file and an inline one fail the
 * same way on a bad `meta` block.
 *
 * Roots mirror `loadCustomAgents` rather than inventing a fourth convention —
 * project `.pi` is the authority, the shared `.agents` workspace is an extra
 * read location, and the user's agent dir is the fallback:
 *
 *   1. <cwd>/.pi/workflows/<name>.js
 *   2. <cwd>/.agents/workflows/<name>.js
 *   3. getAgentDir()/workflows/<name>.js   (default ~/.pi/agent/workflows)
 *
 * Precedence is expressed as first-hit-wins here, not last-write-wins as in the
 * agent loader, because a name resolves to one file — there is no map to
 * overwrite.
 *
 * Symlinks are rejected through `safeReadFile`, and the name is whitelisted
 * before it is ever joined to a path: `name` arrives from a model, and
 * `../../etc/passwd` must not become a readable workflow.
 *
 * ## Not every `.js` in the folder is a workflow
 *
 * These are ordinary directories. `.agents/workflows/` is shared across tools
 * and the user's agent dir is theirs to fill; either may hold a build artifact,
 * a config, or a scratch script. A file is only treated as a workflow if it
 * carries the `export const meta =` declaration every workflow opens with.
 *
 * Nothing is ever executed to decide this — the check is a regex over the
 * source, and even the real parse only evaluates the `meta` object literal in
 * an empty vm. What the filter buys is honesty: a listing that offers `utils.js`
 * as a runnable workflow invites the model to try it, and naming it should say
 * "that is not a workflow" rather than produce a parser error about a block the
 * author never intended to write.
 */
/**
 * The roots a `name` is looked up in, highest priority first.
 *
 * Directories declared by installed pi packages come last, so a project, shared
 * workspace or personal script always wins the name. That is the same tier
 * package-provided agents get, and the same tier pi gives package-provided
 * skills — a package offers a workflow, it never takes a name away from you.
 *
 * The `packageWorkflows` gate and pi's project-trust answer are session state in
 * package-resources.ts rather than parameters here, so a gate set in `/agents`
 * reaches this without an options bag travelling through `resolveWorkflowScript`,
 * `resolveWorkflowSource` and `readSavedWorkflow` purely to be consulted once.
