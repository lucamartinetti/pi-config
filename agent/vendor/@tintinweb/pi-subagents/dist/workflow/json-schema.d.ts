/**
 * json-schema.ts — validating a script-supplied JSON Schema.
 *
 * `agent(prompt, { schema })` hands us a raw JSON Schema written by a model, to
 * be used two ways: as a tool's `parameters` (so the provider fills the fields)
 * and as the check that decides whether what came back is usable.
 *
 * ## Which typebox
 *
 * **`typebox`, not `@sinclair/typebox`.** They are different packages.
 * `@sinclair/typebox` (0.34) dispatches on a `Kind` symbol that a schema
 * arriving over the wire does not carry, so `Value.Check` throws `Unknown type`
 * on a plain JSON Schema — and `Type.Unsafe` does not help, it stamps a `Kind`
 * that is not registered. `typebox` v1 is a standards JSON Schema validator and
 * takes the schema as-is. It is also the package pi itself types
 * `ToolDefinition.parameters` against and supplies to extensions at runtime
 * (a peer dependency here), so the same schema object serves both roles with no
 * conversion.
 *
 * ## Why we validate at all
 *
 * Nothing in pi checks a tool call's arguments against the tool's `parameters`.
 * `validateToolCall`/`validateToolArguments` exist in `pi-ai` but are never
 * called from either shipped package, so a schema on a tool is a *prompt to the
 * provider*, not an enforcement point. Every guarantee the script gets about
 * the shape of its result is made here.
 *
 * Pure and pi-free on purpose, so `runtime.ts` can import it without dragging
 * sessions and models into the runtime's tests.
