/**
 * collisions.ts — deciding what to do when another extension already offers a
 * workflow tool.
 *
 * Workflows are on by default, so this extension can be the *second*
 * orchestrator in a session rather than the only one. Two workflow tools in one
 * spec is worse than either alone: the model has to guess which to call, and
 * pays for both descriptions to find out. The other extension was installed
 * deliberately; a default of ours should not compete with it.
 *
 * ## What counts as a conflict
 *
 * An exact name match against {@link FOREIGN_WORKFLOW_TOOL_NAMES}, from a tool
 * that is not ours. Exact and not a substring on purpose: `Workflow` is a
 * common word in tool names that have nothing to do with orchestration
 * (`github_workflow_run`, `list_workflows`), and silently disabling the feature
 * against one of those would be a bug nobody could see.
 *
 * Two shapes, both decided here:
 *
 * 1. **A foreign tool took our name.** Registration is first-wins across
 *    extensions (`getAllRegisteredTools` skips a name it already has), and the
 *    winner also overwrites a built-in of the same name. Nothing throws, and
 *    there is no tool-conflict diagnostic the way there is for shortcuts. Ours
 *    never reached the registry, so there is nothing to withdraw — but the rest
 *    of the feature (the menu, the CLI flag) is still live and would drive a
 *    tool the model cannot call. It comes down with it.
 * 2. **A foreign tool sits beside ours** under a different name, typically
 *    Claude Code's bare `Workflow`. Both are registered and both are offered.
 *    That one the caller can actually withdraw — `withdraw` says so.
 *
 * Only one direction of case 1 is detectable. If ours registered first, the
 * other extension's tool is the one dropped, and pi exposes no way to see a
 * tool that lost — the registry keeps winners only.
 *
 * Split from the acting half deliberately: everything here is a pure function
 * of the tool list, so the policy can be tested without a host that can be made
 * to register a competing extension. The caller owns `getAllTools`, the notify
 * and the `setActiveTools` — see `resolveWorkflowCollisions` in index.ts.
 */
/**
 * Tool names that mean "another extension already orchestrates subagents".
 *
 * Our own name, because pi resolves a duplicate registration silently, and
 * Claude Code's bare `Workflow`, because a port of that tool is what a second
 * workflow extension most likely calls itself. Lowercase `workflow` is the same
 * tool by pi convention: it is what `@quintinshaw/pi-dynamic-workflows`
 * registers, and the match here is exact, so the case has to be listed by hand.
