/**
 * agent-file-toggle.ts — Pure helpers for the `/agents` file-editing operations:
 * locating an agent's .md file, toggling its `enabled:` frontmatter flag, and
 * serializing an AgentConfig back to frontmatter for eject.
 *
 * These live outside src/index.ts so they can be tested directly: the `/agents`
 * command handler is an ~890-line closure reached only through `registerCommand`,
 * which every test mocks.
 *
 * The read side of this data (src/custom-agents.ts) parses frontmatter with a
 * real YAML parser, so it honors `enabled: false` at any position in the block.
 * This module must agree with it, and splits the work accordingly:
 *
 * - Deciding whether a file is disabled is a *read*, so it calls that same parser
 *   (`isDisabledContent`) instead of mirroring it. A mirror has to be right about
 *   YAML's boolean spellings and about pi's fence scan, and a regex was wrong
 *   about both.
 * - *Editing* cannot go through the parser, because re-serializing a parsed
 *   document would reformat a file the README tells users to hand-author —
 *   discarding their comments, key order, and quoting. So the edits are line-wise
 *   and preserve everything they don't touch.
 *
 * That leaves removal best-effort: it recognizes a lowercase bare `false`, and
 * reports `changed: false` for the spellings it cannot rewrite, so the caller
 * refuses honestly rather than announcing a change it did not make.

 * An agent's type comes from its frontmatter `name:` now, so the two can
 * disagree: `reviewer.md` declaring `name: code-reviewer` is loaded as
 * `code-reviewer`, and probing for `code-reviewer.md` finds nothing. That is
 * not a harmless miss — `/agents → Disable` would then take the no-file branch
 * and write a NEW `code-reviewer.md` stub, which loses to `reviewer.md` on
 * load, leaving the agent enabled while reporting success.
 *
 * The probe stays as the fallback: a built-in that was never ejected has no
 * `sourcePath`, and a path can go stale between a load and this call.
 *
 * **A package agent has no editable file.** Its `sourcePath` points inside pi's
 * install root, where an edit is lost on the next `pi update` and a delete is
 * undone by the next `pi install`. Passing `source` lets that rule live here
 * rather than at each `/agents` call site: the package path is ignored, and the
 * name probe runs instead — which finds the local stub shadowing it, if one
 * exists, and otherwise nothing. Callers then take their no-file branch, which
 * is the Eject-or-shadow behaviour a not-yet-ejected builtin already gets.
